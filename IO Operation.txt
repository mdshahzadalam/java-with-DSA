1.  What is input and output Stream in java?
Ans.   A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.


2.  What are the methods of OutputStream?
Ans.   Write() - writes the specified byte to the output stream.
write(byte[] array) - writes the bytes from the specified array to the output stream.

flush() - forces to write all data present in the output stream to the destination.

close() - closes the output stream.


3.  What is serialization in java?
Ans.  Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to transfer it over a network or to store it in a file or database. In java serialization is done by im[lementating the serializable interface.

4.  What is the Serialization interface in java?
Ans.  The serializable interface in java is a marker interface that has no methods. It is used to mark classes that can be object has been serialized.

5.  What is deserialization in java?
Ans.  Deserialaization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into an object instance. This is done after an object has been serialized.

6.  How is serialization achieved in java?
Ans.  Serialization is achieved in java by implementation the serializable interface.When an object is serialized its state is converted into a stream of bytes which can then be transferred over a network or stored in a file or database.

7.  How is deserialization is achieved in java by reading a str4eam of bytes and using them to recreate the original object instance. This is done by calling the readObject() method of an ObjectInputStream instance.

8.  How can you avoid cetain member variables of class from getting serialized?
Ans.   Mark member various as static or transient and those member will no more be a part of serialization.

9.  What classes are available in the java IO File Classes API?
Ans. The following classes are available in the java IO API and are important to work with files in java.
File
RandomAcessFile
FileInputStream
FileReader
FileOutputStream
FileWriter

10.  What is difference between Externalizable and Serialization interface?
Ans.
Externalization :-
Interface:-Externalization contains two methods readExternal and writeExternal. 

Imlementation :- Externalization provides implementation logic control to the application by overriding readExternal and writeExternal methods.

Perforamance :- We can apply this to externalizable as well.

Serialization :-
Interface :- Serialization is a marker interface 

Implementaion logic :- The class which is implementing this interface gives the responsibility to JVM for serializing or persist java object.  JVM use readObject and writeObject for serialization 

Perforamance :- In serializable interface uses reflection which causes relatively slow performance.
