1.  What is an interface in java?
Ans.  An interface in java is a mechanism that is used to achive complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2.  Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an interface ? Explain with an example.
Ans. only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for method in interfaces.

3.  What is the use of interface in java?
Ans. There are many reasons to use interfaces in java. They are as follows:
(a)An interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
(b)Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projects API to some othe project.
(c)Programmers use interfaces to customise features of software differently objects.
(c)By using interface we can achieve the functionality of multiple inherutance.

4.  What is the different between abstract class and interface in java?
Ans.
Abstract class
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.

Interface
1.Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2.Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3.Interface has only static and final variables.
4.Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
