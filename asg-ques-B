1Q.
What is encapsulation in java? Why it is called data hiding?
Ans.
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
     It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.

2Q.
What are the important features of Encapsulation?
Ans.
Read-only or write-only fields of a class may be generated.
 A class should be in full possession of what is contained in its fields.

3Q.
what are the getter and setter methods in java explain with an example?
Ans.In Java, getter and setter are two conventional methods that are used for retrieving and updating value of a variable. 
Setter :-
public class GetterSetterExample   
{  
    public salary;  
      
    public storeSalaryDB(int salary)  
    {  
        // code for storing the salary in the database  
    }  
      
    // main method  
    public static void main(String argvs[])   
    {  
      GetterSetterExample obj = new GetterSetterExample();      
        
      obj.salary = -50000;  
        
      // storing salary in database  
      obj.storeSalaryDB(salary);  
  
    }  
}  

Getter :-
public class GetterSetterExample   
{  
    private salary;  
      
    // a setter method that assign a   
    // value to the salary variable  
    void setSalary(int s)  
    {  
        if(s < 0 )  
        {  
            s = -s;  
        }  
          
        this.salary = s;  
    }  
      
      
    // a getter mehtod to retrieve   
    // the salary  
    int getSalary()  
    {  
        return this.salary;  
    }  
      
    public storeSalaryDB(int salary)  
    {  
        // code for storing the salary in the database  
         System.out.println("The ")  
    }  
      
    // main method  
    public static void main(String argvs[])   
    {  
        // creating an object of the class GetterSetterExample          
        GetterSetterExample obj = new GetterSetterExample();      
        
      obj.setSalary(-50000);  
        
      int salary = obj.getSalary();  
        
      // storing salary in database  
      obj.storeSalaryDB(salary);  
  
    }  
}  

4Q.
What is the use of this keyword explain with an example?
Ans.
The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name.

5Q.
What is the advantage of encapsulation?
Ans.
Encapsulation provides tons of benefits in everyday programming. Some of the exhilarating benefits are as follows âˆ’

Programming is made flexible with encapsulation. It means you do not need to edit and update code every time according to new specifications.

It helps you in achieving loose coupling.

With encapsulation, it's simple and easy to debug an application.

It is also possible to alter and make edits to your codebase without disrupting the regular functioning of your program.

It enables the programmer to monitor the data accessibility of a class.

6Q.
How to achieve encapsulation in java ? Give an example.
Ans.
Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
class Area {
 
  int length;
  int breadth;
 
  // constructor to initialize values
  Area(int length, int breadth) {
    this.length = length;
    this.breadth = breadth;
  }
 
  // method to calculate area
  public void getArea() {
    int area = length * breadth;
    System.out.println("Area: " + area);
  }
}
 
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
 
    Area rectangle = new Area(2, 16);
    rectangle.getArea();
  }
}
