1. What is a Map in java.
Ans. A map is a collection in java that stores data as key value pairs where aech key is unique.

2. What are the commonly used implementation of Java are HashMap , LinkedHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.

3. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Ans. HashMap is an unordered collection that uses hashing to store the key value pairs while TreeMap is a sorted collection that stores the key value pairs in a sorted order based oon the natural order of the keys or a custom comporator.

4. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?
Ans. We can check if a key exists in a Map in Map in Java using the containsKey() method or the get() method. The containsKey() method returns a boolean value indicating whether the Map contains the specified key while the get() method returns the value associated with the specified key or null if the key isnot present in the Map.

5.  What are Generics in Java?
Ans. Generics in Java are used to provide type safety and reduce code redundancy by allowing the use of generics types. It allows cllasses, methods, and interfaces to be written generically without specifying the type of data being used.

6. What are the benefits of using Generics in Java?
Ans. The benefits of using Generics in Java are:
Type safety
code reusability
Improved readability
Reduced code redundancy
Improved performance

7. What is a Generic Class in Java?
Ans. A Generic Class in Java is a class that can work with different types of data. It is defined using a type parameter enclosed in angle brackets, which represents the type of data being used.

8. What is a type Parameter in Java Generics?
Ans. A type Parameter in Java Generic is a placeholder for the type of datathat is used by a generic class or method. It is defined using a single uppercase letter enclosed in angle brackets such as <T> or <E>.

9. What is a Generic Method in Java?
Ans. A Generic Method in Java is a method tha tcan work with different types of data. It is defined using a type parameter enclosed in angle brackets which repersents the type of data being used.

10. What is the different between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?
Ans. ArrayList is a non-generic class, while ArrayList<T> is a generic class. 
ArrayList<T> provides type safety, as it can only store elements of the specified type whereas ArraList can store any type of elements.
