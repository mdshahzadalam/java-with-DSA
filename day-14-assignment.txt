Q5.
What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects?
Ans.
Mutable Objects
The mutable objects are objects whose value can be changed after initialization. We can change the object's values, such as field and states, after the object is created. For example, Java.util.Date, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, etc.

Immutable Objects
The immutable objects are objects whose value can not be changed after initialization. We can not change anything once the object is created. For example, primitive objects such as int, long, float, double, all legacy classes, Wrapper class, String class, etc.

Q6.
Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?
Ans.
A string constant pool is a separate place in the heap memory where the values of all the strings which are defined in the program are stored.
